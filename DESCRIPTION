Description: Introduces the S-type estimator, a novel robust estimator for analyzing general linear regression models, as proposed by Sazak and Mutlu (2025).
This package implements the S-type estimator to address issues of outlier contamination and leverage points, providing a robust alternative to traditional methods.
Users can compute regression results using the S-type estimator and perform diagnostics to assess model fit and performance. 
The package is designed for applied researchers and statisticians seeking advanced tools for robust regression analysis.
The implementation and methodology are based on the study, "Comparison of the Robust Methods in the General Linear Regression Model" by Sazak and Mutlu (2025).
