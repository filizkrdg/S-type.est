Description: Implements the S-type estimator, a novel robust estimator for general linear regression models,
    addressing challenges such as outlier contamination and leverage points. This package introduces robust
    regression techniques to provide a robust alternative to classical methods and includes diagnostic tools
    for assessing model fit and performance. The methodology is based on the study, "Comparison of the Robust
    Methods in the General Linear Regression Model" by Sazak and Mutlu (2025). This package is designed for
    statisticians and applied researchers seeking advanced tools for robust regression analysis.
